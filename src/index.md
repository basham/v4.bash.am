    | I&rsquo;m Chris, a designer and front-end developer for [Indiana University](https://uits.iu.edu/) in [Bloomington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomington,_Indiana). I work on a cross-functional Agile team, building enterprise Web software for students, advisors, and faculty. I'm interested in [application development](#application-development), [design systems](#design-systems), and [team practices](#team-practices). I experiment with new design and development techniques, and I train coworkers on best practices.

## Application development

In 2013, I started experimenting with using the [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) framework for building functional prototypes, such as new interfaces for students [<mark>viewing their billing information</mark>](/work/iu-student-billing), [<mark>searching for courses</mark>](/work/iu-course-search), and [<mark>registering for classes</mark>](/work/ks-course-registration). Each proof-of-concept built on the next, teaching me about REST APIs, minification, version control ([git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/)), accessibility ([WAI-ARIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAI-ARIA)), build systems ([Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) and [gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com/)), NoSQL databases ([Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)), and mobile-first and responsive design.

From 2014 to 2016, I studied CSS, trying to determine best practices for [using CSS units](https://gist.github.com/basham/2175a16ab7c60ce8e001), [integrating media queries](https://gist.github.com/basham/3b24062dfaecaa712a68), [organizing project files](https://gist.github.com/basham/877db54fffb08e47bd39), and [<mark>setting style naming conventions</mark>](/talks/architecting-css).

In 2015, I shifted to [React](https://reactjs.org/) as my rendering library choice.

React. Reflux as simplier Flux. AdRx Quick Notes in 2015. SAS Student in 2015. Cycle.js. RxJS experiments in 2016. SER in 2017. Conduit in 2017.

## Design systems

In mid-2013, as part of a partnership between the [Kuali Foundation](https://kuali.org/) and [Indiana University](https://www.iu.edu/), I started working on the Kuali Student project on the Core Design Team. In this role, I worked alongside the designers of several product teams, to encourage collaboration, alignment, and community. As such, I helped kickoff a UI pattern library called the [<mark>Kuali Student Design Guide</mark>](/work/ks-design-guide) to start establishing standards and best practices. While the project didn't have time to mature because of the dissolution of the Kuali Student teams, I learned about the complexities of such a system, such as maintenance, political buy-in, versioning, documentation, and governance.

In late 2014, I was assigned to one of several newly formed product teams under the university's Enterprise Student Systems (ESS) division. After a year of understanding the technical directions of the products and the needs of the teams, I started development of the ESS Component Library, as a way to establish a common set of UI components, icons, and colors. The components were built using [React](https://reactjs.org/), vetted by the university's [accessibility experts](https://atac.iu.edu/), and published to the university's enterprise [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/). Icons used a mix of custom icons and the [Iconic set](https://useiconic.com/). A [<mark>new color palette</mark>](/work/iu-color-palette) was adapted from the university's brand colors, and [<mark>color variations were systematically generated and codified</mark>](/articles/codifying-colors/). Over the course of two years, we published dozens of components and icons, while integrating them into about a half-dozen new products. 

In late 2016, the university established the [User Experience Office](https://ux.iu.edu/) to oversee design efforts across offices, departments, and schools. In collaboration with the university's design and development communities, they maintain the [Rivet Software Design System](https://rivet.iu.edu/), and it has experienced an exponential growth in adoption. I am a regular contributor to Rivet, sharing many lessons learned from my prior design system projects.

## Team practices

Faciliation. Agile. Lean UX. User research. Accessibility. Roles. Training. Designer facilitates the design process, not owns it.
