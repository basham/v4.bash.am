Tasked with building a proof of concept web application for Indiana University students to search and bookmark classes, this six-week project was the first attempt within the [University Information Technology Services department](http://uits.iu.edu/) to pair a client-side framework ([AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)) with [REST web services](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) for a student-facing application.
