# Hi, Internet dwellers

I&rsquo;m Chris Basham, an [interaction designer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_design) and [front-end developer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_end_development) living in the quaint town of [Bloomington, Indiana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomington,_Indiana). Since <time datetime="2012-07">mid-2012</time>, I&rsquo;ve worked for [Indiana University](http://www.iu.edu/), designing and developing various student-related web software.

When not slicing fingers with sticky notes or [refactoring repositories](https://github.com/basham), I&rsquo;m desperately convincing others to play a backed [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/1468456177) game, fervently listening to an [audiobook](http://www.audible.com) or [podcast](http://99percentinvisible.org/), or blissfully running the trails in my [sandals](http://www.lunasandals.com/).
