Inspired by adventuring in the great outdoors, we explore principles, practices, and patterns that can guide those designing a web navigation experience. How do we design for users wanting to browse content or just wanting to efficiently accomplish a given task? How does context, such as resource constraints, prior knowledge, knowledge acquisition, and personal experience affect how a user traverses an interface? How can navigational experiences adapt for context?
