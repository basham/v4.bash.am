<p>The <a href="http://ksux.github.io/ks-design-guide/">Kuali Student Design Guide</a> is an initial foundation for a design pattern library created to centralize and articulate user interface design decisions occurring within the <a href="http://www.kuali.org/ks">Kuali Student</a> products. The guide is meant to be maintained by Kuali designers and front-end developers, regularly updated as problems are encountered and resolved throughout development. Patterns are abstracted as nested components, following the <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Atomic design methodology</a>. It serves as a daily reference for designers and developers, yet also invites the larger non-design community to see and engage in the process. Research and recommendations are initially documented as <a href="https://github.com/ksux/ks-design-guide/issues">repository issues</a> before being adopted into the guide.</p>

<h2 id="course-registration-proof-of-concept">Course Registration proof of concept</h2>
<p><time datetime="2013-12">December 2013</time> &ndash; <time datetime="2014-01">January 2014</time></p>
<p>Using the recommendations as outlined in the <a href="/articles/mobile-strategies-for-kuali-student"><cite>Mobile Strategies for Kuali Student</cite></a> document, a proof of concept for a university course registration application was developed over a period of six weeks as part of an initiation phase for the student enrollment product. The application features a responsive, mobile-first interface, developed in <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>.</p>
<h3 id="backstory">Backstory</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.kuali.org/ks">Kuali Student</a> project is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_information_system">student information system</a> <a href="http://www.kuali.org/about/history">established by the Kuali Foundation in 2007</a>. Over the initial years, the primary objective was to build the administrative foundation, which included <a href="http://www.kuali.org/ks/functionality/cm">Curriculum Management</a> and <a href="http://www.kuali.org/ks/functionality/enr">Course Offering</a>. These applications defined essential relationships, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a course, and how is it offered for any given academic term?</li>
<li>How do the culmination of attended classes constitute an academic degree?</li>
</ul>
<p>With this data in place, Kuali Student started to prepare for Registration, which would enable students to search and register for classes for a given academic term. As the first student-facing application within this suite of tools, there was no precedent to follow, and all recognized how different of a user experience is needed when students, not administrators, are the primary audience.</p>
<p>In understanding that there were numerous unknowns regarding the best approach for either design or development, I authored a <a href="/articles/mobile-strategies-for-kuali-student">document listing a number of recommendations</a> in order to guide the process along, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>designing baseline experiences which can be enhanced according to device capabilities or context;</li>
<li>building a single responsive application, rather than multiple applications intended for different categories of devices;</li>
<li>ensuring the application is accessible according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAI-ARIA">WAI-ARIA</a> specifications;</li>
<li>serving data via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST web services</a> in order to decouple user interfaces from back-end concerns;</li>
<li>and generally encouraging more freedom when choosing tools.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="Button" href="/articles/mobile-strategies-for-kuali-student">Read <cite>Mobile Strategies for Kuali Student</cite></a></p>
<p>Backing these recommendations, leadership allocated six weeks to develop a proof of concept application that embodied these recommendations.</p>
<h3 id="process">Process</h3>
<p>While a separate team prepared the back-end to offer a web services layer, I spent most of the first couple weeks sketching and producing wireframes of the interface, keeping in mind small and larger viewports.</p>

<p>Leveraging my experience using the <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> framework the past year for Indiana University projects, I was able to quickly develop the general architecture of the front-end. Once the markup and styles fleshed out, data embedded into the markup was abstracted into static <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> fixtures, and the template was altered to be dynamically driven by these fixtures. With the fixtures as a guide, the services team was able to adapt the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API">web API</a> to match the fixtures. By the third week, the fixtures were starting to be replaced by live web services.</p>

<p>Even though the proof of concept was primarily concerned with the technical feasibility of this approach, I was still able to receive rudimentary student feedback to guide refinement of the user interface throughout the entire project, by means of an Indiana University undergraduate intern.</p>
<p>In order to ensure basic accessibility, the proof of concept was frequently tested with a keyboard as the sole input device.</p>
<h3 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h3>
<p>The proof of concept successfully demonstrated the rapid speed of development capable by decoupling the front-end from the back-end, the engaging user experience possible through modern client-side JavaScript frameworks, and the incredible performance of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST web services</a>. Based on these results, the development team has continued this general architecture, producing higher quality user experiences in less time than sibling teams.</p>
<p>For the first few months following the proof of concept, I guided the Registration development team as they learned AngularJS, and I frequently provided feedback regarding both design and development directions.</p>

<h3 id="reflection">Reflection</h3>
<p>Since the purpose of the proof of concept was challenging technical concerns over design concerns, a number of design compromises were made. By devoting either more time or a second designer to the project, more effort would have been placed in refining lower fidelity ideas before rushing into code; a visual style would be explored, especially regarding typography and color; and further feedback would be gathered from students, including those proficient with assistive technologies.</p>

<p><time datetime="2013-03">March</time> &ndash; <time datetime="2013-05">May 2013</time></p>
<p>Tasked with building a proof of concept web application for <a href="http://www.iu.edu/">Indiana University</a> students to search and bookmark classes, this six-week project was the first attempt within the <a href="http://uits.iu.edu/">University Information Technology Services department</a> to pair a client-side framework (<a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>) with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST web services</a> for a student-facing application.</p>

<p><time datetime="2013-03">March</time> &ndash; <time datetime="2013-05">May 2013</time></p>
<p>In late 2012, the <a href="http://www.iu.edu/">Indiana University</a> student billing user interface was redesigned in order to make it easier for students to understand their monthly statements and pay the balance on their accounts. After numerous low-fidelity design iterations and subsequent user tests, a functional prototype was crafted in <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> as a model for the production version.</p>
