To better handle the intricacies of developing modern web services, [Kuali Student](http://www.kuali.org/ks) has integrated UI developers into all product streams. We highlight the importance of this role and the skillsets they contribute to the team. We also discuss the increasing complexity of modern and future front-end interfaces and user expectations. Finally, we outline an ideal modern UI dev workflow and the plethora of tools available.

Presented at [Kuali Days 2014](http://www.kuali.org/kd/2014).

Inspired by adventuring in the great outdoors, we explore principles, practices, and patterns that can guide those designing a web navigation experience. How do we design for users wanting to browse content or just wanting to efficiently accomplish a given task? How does context, such as resource constraints, prior knowledge, knowledge acquisition, and personal experience affect how a user traverses an interface? How can navigational experiences adapt for context?
