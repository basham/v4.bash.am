To better handle the intricacies of developing modern web services, [Kuali Student](http://www.kuali.org/ks) has integrated UI developers into all product streams. We highlight the importance of this role and the skillsets they contribute to the team. We also discuss the increasing complexity of modern and future front-end interfaces and user expectations. Finally, we outline an ideal modern UI dev workflow and the plethora of tools available.
