## Kuali Student Design Guide

<time datetime="2014-03">March</time> &ndash; <time datetime="2014-08">August 2014</time>

The [Kuali Student Design Guide](http://ksux.github.io/ks-design-guide/) is an initial foundation for a design pattern library created to centralize and articulate user interface design decisions occurring within the [Kuali Student](http://www.kuali.org/ks) products. The guide is meant to be maintained by Kuali designers and front-end developers, regularly updated as problems are encountered and resolved throughout development. Patterns are abstracted as nested components, following the [Atomic design methodology](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/). It serves as a daily reference for designers and developers, yet also invites the larger non-design community to see and engage in the process. Research and recommendations are initially documented as [repository issues](https://github.com/ksux/ks-design-guide/issues) before being adopted into the guide.

## Course Registration proof of concept

<time datetime="2013-12">December 2013</time> &ndash; <time datetime="2014-01">January 2014</time>

Using the recommendations as outlined in the [Mobile Strategies for Kuali Student](/mobile-strategies-for-kuali-student) document, a proof of concept for a university course registration application was developed over a period of six weeks as part of an initiation phase for the student enrollment product. The application features a responsive, mobile-first layout, developed in [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).

The proof of concept successfully demonstrated the rapid speed of development capable by decoupling the front-end from the back-end, the engaging user experience possible through modern client-side JavaScript frameworks, and the incredible performance of [REST web services](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). Based on these results, the development team has continued this general architecture, producing higher quality user experiences in less time than sibling teams.

## Mobile Strategies for Kuali Student

<time datetime="2013-12">December 2013</time>

As part of the initiation phase for a new product within [Kuali Student](http://www.kuali.org/ks), a document was produced recommending how best to approach this new product, which would be one of the first Kuali applications in which students, not administrators, would be the primary users. The document recommends:

* designing baseline experiences which can be enhanced according to device capabilities or context;
* building a single responsive application, rather than multiple applications intended for different categories of devices;
* ensuring the application is accessible according to [WAI-ARIA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAI-ARIA) specifications;
* serving data via [REST web services](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) in order to decouple user interfaces from back-end concerns;
* and generally encouraging more freedom when choosing tools.

Six weeks were allocated to develop a [proof of concept application that embodied these recommendations](#course-registration-proof-of-concept).

## Course Search proof of concept

<time datetime="2013-03">March</time> &ndash; <time datetime="2013-05">May 2013</time>

Tasked with building a proof of concept web application for [Indiana University](http://www.iu.edu/) students to search and bookmark classes, this six-week project was the first attempt within the [University Information Technology Services department](http://uits.iu.edu/) to pair a client-side framework ([AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)) with [REST web services](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) for a student-facing application.

## Student Billing functional prototype

<time datetime="2013-03">March</time> &ndash; <time datetime="2013-05">May 2013</time>

In late 2012, the [Indiana University](http://www.iu.edu/) student billing user interface was redesigned in order to make it easier for students to understand their monthly statements and pay the balance on their accounts. After numerous low-fidelity design iterations and subsequent user tests, a functional prototype was crafted in [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) as a model for the production version.
