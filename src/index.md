## Design Systems

In mid-2013, as part of a partnership between the [Kuali Foundation](https://kuali.org/) and [Indiana University](https://www.iu.edu/), I started working on the Kuali Student project on the Core Design Team. In this role, I worked alongside the designers of several product teams, to encourage collaboration, alignment, and community. As such, I helped kickoff a UI pattern library called the [Kuali Student Design Guide](/work/ks-design-guide) to start establishing standards and best practices. While the project didn't have time to mature because of the dissolution of the Kuali Student teams, I learned about the complexities of such a system, such as maintenance, political buy-in, versioning, documentation, and governance.

In late 2014, I was assigned to one of several newly formed product teams under the university's Enterprise Student Systems (ESS) division. After a year of understanding the technical directions of the products and the needs of the teams, I started development of the ESS Component Library, as a way to establish a common set of UI components, icons, and colors. The components were built using [React](https://reactjs.org/), vetted by the university's [accessibility experts](https://atac.iu.edu/), and published to the university's enterprise [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/). Icons used a mix of custom icons and the [Iconic set](https://useiconic.com/). A [new color palette](/work/iu-color-palette) was adapted from the university's brand colors, and [color variations were systematically generated and codified](/articles/codifying-colors/). Over the course of two years, we published dozens of components and icons, while integrating them into about a half-dozen new products. 

In late 2017, the university established the [User Experience Office](https://ux.iu.edu/) to oversee design efforts across offices, departments, and schools. In collaboration with the university's design and development communities, they maintain the [Rivet Software Design System](https://rivet.iu.edu/), and it has experienced an exponential growth in adoption. I am a regular contributor to Rivet, sharing many lessons learned from my prior design system projects.
