Dear Hiring Manager:

I'm writing to declare my interest in the [Interaction Designer position](https://www.google.com/about/careers/search?#!t=jo&jid=121465001) at [Google's Boulder office](http://www.google.com/about/careers/locations/boulder/). <a href="http://www.google.com/design/about/"><q cite="http://www.google.com/design/about/">Good design is never done,</q></a> and by aligning with the Boulder team and [Google's corporate-wide design efforts](http://www.google.com/design/articles/welcome-to-the-new-google-design/), such as the [Material Design specification](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html), I can make meaningful contributions to the design of Google Docs, Chrome OS, and other user-facing productivity services.

I've focused my career on mastering the core technologies of the Web and how to wisely purpose them into applications. As an interaction designer, I [shape how applications should be and behave](/articles/storytellers/), guiding decisions of a product and service to [help people live better and richer lives](/articles/heartbeats/). As a front-end developer, I manifest that shape into reality, ensuring every byte sent to the user is intentional.

For the last three years, I've worked for [Indiana University's information technology department](https://uits.iu.edu/), teaching user experience and front-end development to a variety of enterprise software teams. I've guided several projects toward adopting modern practices, such as responsive design, progressive enhancement, accessibility, and single-page applications. I've researched and established style guide and user interface component standards, unifying the look, behavior, and expectations of software maintained by different teams.

In late 2013, I authored a document outlining a variety of [strategies for student-facing Web software](/articles/mobile-strategies-for-kuali-student/). Using these recommendations, I lead the development of a [proof of concept for a university course registration application](/work/#course-registration-proof-of-concept), which featured a mobile-friendly interface developed in [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/). Based on the success of this project, the development team has continued using this architecture, producing higher quality user experiences in less time than sibling teams. In early 2015, I conducted a similar exercise with another development team using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), producing very comparable results to the 2013 project.

My expertise would be of great value to Google, and based on my research, it is the type of place I want to work. It is a culture that embraces design and engineering, and the environment would provide ample opportunity to both mentor and be mentored. I appreciate your consideration of my experience and interests, and I would welcome the chance to speak with you about the Interaction Designer position.

Sincerely,
